# MOVIE-QUIZ-GAME /APPLICATION-USING-PYTHON AND MY SQL

## Description

Developed an interactive Python-based quiz game testing knowledge of MOVIES. 

This Python project implements a quiz game focused on Movies. It quizzes players on their knowledge of recent Telugu films, including directors, actors, music composers, and awards. The quiz consists of 15 multiple-choice questions, each with options A, B, C, and D. After completing the quiz, the program evaluates the player's responses and provides a score based on correctness.
Sure, here's a detailed description for GitHub:




### Features

1. **Quiz Setup**: The script begins by displaying a series of 15 questions about Telugu cinema, each with four possible answers.
  
2. **User Interaction**: Users input their answers, and the script validates these against predefined correct answers. It tracks scores and displays whether answers are correct or incorrect in real-time.

3. **Scoring and Feedback**: For each correct answer, users earn points, and their total score accumulates throughout the quiz. At the end of the quiz, a summary displays the total number of correct and incorrect answers, along with the total points earned.

4. **Reward System**: Depending on the total score achieved, users are rewarded with virtual cash prizes. High scorers may also receive additional gifts such as electronic devices or cashback bonuses.

5. **Replayability**: After each quiz session, users are given the option to play again or exit the quiz. All scores, gifts, and additional cashback are stored and displayed in a final report after users finish playing.
6. After end of the game,  detailed report is generated consists:

  -> Total number of users who played the quiz.
  -> Individual scores of each player.
  -> Gifts awarded to players based on their scores.
  -> Additional cashback rewarded for high scores.
7.Implemented a database to store scores and player statistics.
Utilized a database (SQLite, MySQL, etc.) to:
- Store quiz questions, correct answers, and user scores.
- Maintain a leaderboard to display top scores.
- Allow users to log in and track their quiz history and performance over time.

The script uses dictionaries to store scores (all_score), gifts (all_gifts), and additional cashback (add_cash). It iterates through these dictionaries to print a structured report for each user.

### Implementation

- **Questions and Answers**: Questions are stored in multiline strings within a dictionary, paired with their correct answer keys ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd').
  
- **Validation and Feedback**: User inputs are validated against predefined correct answers using a loop until valid input is received. Feedback (correct or incorrect) and scoring are provided immediately after each question.
  
- **Gifts and Cash Prizes**: Rewards are determined based on the total score achieved. Depending on the score range, users receive different types of virtual rewards and bonuses.



# Usage:

•	STEP 1: Clone the repository and run the Python script.
•	STEP 2: Enter your name and proceed to answer the quiz questions.
•	STEP 3: Enjoy the quiz experience and see how well you know about movies!


# Technologies Used:

1.Python
Data Structures Used : dictionary,lists 
2.Random module for gifts selection


# Future Enhancements:

o	Adding more quiz questions to expand the scope.

o	Incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.

o	This project serves as an entertaining way to test your knowledge of Movies and can be customized further for educational purposes or entertainment events.
Certainly! Here are some further enhancements and features that could be added to the Telugu cinema quiz game:

### 1 **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

Integrate a GUI using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt to enhance the user interface, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly. This would include:
- Buttons for selecting answers.
- Progress bars or indicators for tracking quiz completion.
- Pop-up windows for displaying feedback and rewards.


### 3. **Multiple Quiz Categories**

Expand beyond Telugu cinema to include quizzes on:
- Bollywood movies.
- Hollywood films.
- General knowledge.
- Specific genres (action, romance, comedy, etc.).
This would cater to a broader audience and provide more variety.

### 4. **Difficulty Levels**

Implement different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard):
- Easy: Basic questions about popular movies and actors.
- Medium: More detailed questions about directors, music composers, etc.
- Hard: Challenging questions about lesser-known facts and trivia.

### 5. **Timer and Challenge Mode**

Introduce a timer for each question or a challenge mode where users compete against the clock:
- Award bonus points for answering questions quickly and accurately.
- Display countdown timers for added excitement and challenge.

### 6. **Interactive Tutorials or Help Section**

Include a tutorial or help section:
- Explain the rules and scoring system.
- Provide tips for answering questions correctly.
- Offer hints or lifelines (e.g., ask the audience, skip question) for difficult questions.

### 7. **Sound Effects and Animations**

Enhance user engagement with:
- Sound effects for correct and incorrect answers.
- Animated transitions between questions and quiz sections.
- Background music to create a more immersive experience.

### 8. **Mobile-Friendly Version**

Develop a responsive design to make the quiz accessible on smartphones and tablets:
- Optimize layout and functionality for smaller screens.
- Support touch gestures for selecting answers and navigating through questions.

### 9. **Social Media Integration**

Allow users to share their quiz results and achievements on social media platforms:
- Implement sharing buttons for platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
- Encourage competition and interaction among friends by comparing scores.

### 10. **Localization and Language Support**

Extend support for multiple languages:
- Translate quiz questions and answers into languages other than English.
- Allow users to select their preferred language before starting the quiz.

- ### Conclusion

This script serves as an interactive way for users to test their knowledge of recent Telugu cinema while providing instant feedback and rewards based on their performance. It utilizes basic Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and input/output operations to create a functional quiz game environment. This project can be further expanded with additional features such as more questions, different quiz categories, or a graphical user interface for enhanced user experience.
